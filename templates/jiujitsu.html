              Jiu-jitsu is easily one of the most difficult things 
              I have had the pleasure of doing. It has taught me focus and the discipline to handle adversity. 
              I am now in a position to teach what I have learned along the way, which continues to be an amazing and 
              fullfilling part of my life.

                  So, thanksgiving came and went and #fatwence was in full effect. Then, I 
                  caught the cold and I was out for another week! I definitely
                  noticed it's effects during my first week back in training and I was getting
                  wrecked by everyone in the gym. As crazy as it sounds, I think it was good 
                  for me, to manage my expectations and ground me. Ego has been checked and 
                  all is well. Oss!

                  Since completing the bootcamp, I've finally been able to train more! Now the challenging part is figuring
                  out how to balance Jiu-jitsu, my 
                  <a href="http://www.wencecajucom.com/pta" target="_blank">
                  full-time gig
                  </a>
                  , reviewing tech projects, looking for work in tech, and spening quality time with my fianc√©. After coming back
                  to training, there were definitely some rust to knock off. However, There were times where I wasn't sure that it
                  was actual rust, or if I was thinking too highly of my skills before the break. Maybe a bit of both? I know for
                  sure that my teammates are getting stronger and have been advancing while I was gone, which is great. This time
                  around, I've noticed that my jiu-jitsu is a little bit more playful and that I don't care as much about getting
                  in bad positions. I'm just happy to be back.

                  Since starting the <a href="http://kickstartcoding.com/" target="_blank">Kickstart Coding</a> program
                  I have not been able to train as much as I used to! I usually trained between three to five times a 
                  week, and now I'm lucky to make it to <em>any</em> kind of training twice a week. However, I keep 
                  reminding myself what I usually tell people when they ask me: <br><br>
                  Jiujitsu will always be around. Just show up.

                  Last Sunday a few of our 
                  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carlsongraciealameda_rct/" target="_blank">
                    team
                  </a> 
                  members participated in a local tournament. While some teammates did well, others,
                  unfortunately, did not. It is a part of the game that everyone goes through. One of 
                  our coaches had this to say:</p>
                <p class="lead jjabout2" style="text-align: center;">
                  <em>
                    "Accept your wins graciosly and study your loss ferociously. <br>
                  In that loss is the secret to your future wins."
                  </em>
                </p>
                <p class="lead jjabout2">That had a profound impact for me. No, I didn't compete this weekend, but that advice
                  resonated and is applicable with anything in life.
